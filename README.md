<h1> Iris Classification Project using the K-nearest neibours algorithm </h1>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p> This project aims to be a solution to one of the most classic 
  classification problems in Machine Learning. The algorithm used was K-nn 
  which verifies the proximity to the entered die based on the Euclidean 
  distance. In this way, the data receives the label that corresponds to the 
  data closest to it.  </p>
